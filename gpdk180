*Objective*:

Capture the schematic of a CMOS inverter with 0.1 pF load capacitance.
Simulate three different transistor width configurations:
WN = WP
WN = 2 Ã— WP
WN = WP / 2

Perform Transient and DC Analysis.
Calculate:
High-to-Low Propagation Delay (tpHL)
Low-to-High Propagation Delay (tpLH)
Average Propagation Delay (tPD)

Design Layout and run DRC, LVS, and post-layout simulations.
