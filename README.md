# CMOS-INVERTER

CMOS Inverter Design, Schematic Capture, Layout and Simulation using Cadence Virtuoso (gpdk180)

**Objective**:

 Capture the schematic of a CMOS inverter with 0.1 pF load capacitance.
 
Simulate three different transistor width configurations:
WN = WP
WN = 2 Ã— WP
WN = WP / 2

Perform Transient and DC Analysis.

Calculate:

High-to-Low Propagation Delay (tpHL)

Low-to-High Propagation Delay (tpLH)

Average Propagation Delay (tPD)

Design Layout and run DRC, LVS, and post-layout simulations.
